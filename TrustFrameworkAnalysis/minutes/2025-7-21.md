# Minutes 

The meeting introduced participants to a trust frameworks subgroup focused on analyzing existing schemes and identifying gaps for interoperability, with Nick providing background on a spreadsheet tool for comparing 11 global frameworks. The group discussed the relationship between policy frameworks and technical implementations, exploring how different countries approach identity verification through both high-level policies and specific technical specifications. The conversation concluded with discussions about terminology clarification, framework analysis processes, and the transition from a community group to a working group approach for the project.

The meeting introduced participants to the trust frameworks subgroup, which aims to analyze existing schemes, identify gaps, and create outcomes for interoperability. Nick provided background on the spreadsheet created to guide the subgroup's work, and participants shared their roles and interests in the project. The group discussed the importance of trust frameworks in identity management and credentialing, with several members expressing interest in understanding different implementations and perspectives worldwide.

**Cross-Framework Policy Analysis Tool**
Nick explained the development of a cross-framework analysis tool that compares policy characteristics and values across 11 global frameworks, starting with publicly published frameworks like UK, US, EU, and Canada. Elizabeth, who works for the OpenID Foundation as Strategy and Marketing Director, introduced herself and mentioned her involvement with City Hub, a collaboration between OpenID Foundation and the Secure Identity Alliance that manages the trust framework work. Dave requested guidance on how to approach analyzing the questions from a spreadsheet, and Nick described the method used to analyze the frameworks, which involved examining policy documents and organizing them into policy areas, characteristics, and values.

**Consent and Identity Framework Evolution**
Nick discussed the evolution of frameworks for addressing consent and identity verification, noting that while initial frameworks showed a wide range of characteristics and values, the diversity has begun to stabilize as different organizations address similar problems. He explained that the analysis started with government-defined public policy frameworks at a high level, but has expanded to include more specific technical implementations like Singapore's Sing Pass and Sweden's national identity method, as well as the EU's UDI wallet with its detailed technical specifications. Nick emphasized that while some frameworks are policy-focused and others are more technical, many countries may have both levels of implementation, creating a two-layer approach to identity verification.

**Framework Analysis and Value Alignment**
Nick explained the structure of the framework analysis, emphasizing the importance of matching existing values where possible to ensure interoperability. He noted that new values are acceptable, as they can highlight unique policy choices, but aligning with existing values is preferred. Dave acknowledged that their current spreadsheet may need updating and agreed to work with Elizabeth to ensure the values facilitate mapping. They discussed the approach of comparing frameworks at the national level, such as TDF and New Zealand's scheme, and Nick confirmed this was designed for comparing framework-level elements.

**Identity Frameworks and Implementation Standards**
The discussion focused on understanding the relationship between different identity frameworks and implementations. Nick and Dave clarified that frameworks define policy and accreditation standards, while implementations like Connect ID specify technical details. Rick added that in their context, TDF (now replaced by legislation) sets policy requirements without prescribing technical standards, while AGDIS operates at a technical level consistent with policy. The conversation concluded with Nick noting that the EU's architecture reference framework is more prescriptive about technical implementation than typical frameworks, suggesting a need to balance policy and technical specifications for global identity interoperability

**Digital Identity Interoperability Challenges**
Nick discussed the challenges of achieving interoperability in digital identity systems, highlighting that while technical standards exist, governments often lack the prescriptive policies needed to enforce them. He noted that the UK is moving towards more technical prescription in data formats to improve interoperability, though it stops short of mandating specific standards like OIDC. Dave and Nick explored a use case involving a ski instructor working in both Australia and Japan, which would require addressing both technical and policy aspects such as consent, trust marks, and wallet verification across different ecosystems.

**MDL Trust Framework Integration**
Nick explained that MDL is a specification focused on presentation and data standards for driving licenses, particularly in the US, and is used as a face-to-face method of proximity authentication. Elizabeth highlighted that while the MDL standard is technical, trust frameworks like AMVA determine policies surrounding its use, such as server or device retrieval methods. Both agreed that MDL is part of a broader trust framework, with silence on how to obtain MDLs and bind them to users, emphasizing the need for policies to support technical standards.

**Clarifying Framework, Scheme, and Specification**
Nick, Olaf, and Natalie discussed the terminology used in standards and frameworks, focusing on the concepts of framework, scheme, and specification. Nick explained that a scheme is a more detailed implementation that specializes the framework for specific use cases, while Olaf suggested that the motor vehicle authorities could be considered at the scheme level, setting policy rules. Natalie proposed that AG (likely a system or framework) underpins Actus, but there was some confusion about Nick's previous statement. The group agreed to continue the discussion over wine, acknowledging the complexity and ambiguity of the terminology.

**Framework Analysis Tool Normalization Discussion**
The group discussed the analysis and normalization process for a framework comparison tool, with Nick explaining the four-step process: policy review, feedback, normalization, and agreement. Gareth emphasized the need to determine the appropriate level of analysis (use case, sector, or scheme) and align on definitions. The team agreed to continue discussions on the right level of detail and how to integrate the analysis with City's broader work. Victoria raised a concern about using an incomplete version of the tool, and Elizabeth offered to share the full version. The group also briefly discussed the transition from a community group to a working group approach for this project.

# ACTIONS

1. Dave to obtain the full version of the trust framework analysis tool from Elizabeth. - DONE
2. Dave to ensure the group has the correct spreadsheet with all characteristics and values for capturing information. - DONE
3. Dave and the group to decide on the appropriate level (use case, sector, or scheme) at which to conduct their analysis.
4. Dave to create a layered picture of the different frameworks and implementations being analyzed.
5. Victoria to review the full version of the trust framework analysis tool once received.
6. The group to consider using Slack for more frequent communication between meetings to develop and refine their work.
7. Dave to schedule follow-up discussions with Nick for normalization activities.
