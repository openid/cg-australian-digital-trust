# Global Digital Identity Interoperability Subgroup

As digital identity ecosystems evolve globally, ensuring interoperability between Australia’s Digital ID frameworks and international schemes is crucial for seamless cross-border identity verification and trust. This subgroup will build upon the existing mapping activity documented in the “Survey on Trust Framework Policy Characteristics” and insights from the “Digital ID DNA – Interoperability Across Trust Frameworks” report. 

There has been some early work completed to compare Australia’s Digital ID framework against key global trust frameworks, including eIDAS2 (EU), NIST 800-63 (US), UK DIATF, Canada DIACC, Singpass (Singapore), and BankID (Sweden) - this working group will pick this up and drive through to completion and presentation with the SIDI Hub. 

To deepen practical insights, the subgroup will focus on mapping Australia’s framework to Japan’s digital identity standards as a specific use case. This will help identify key interoperability challenges, technical alignment opportunities, and policy considerations, paving the way for future bilateral and multilateral recognition of digital identities. The outcome will be a refined comparative analysis and recommendations report, guiding Australia’s approach to global digital identity interoperability.
