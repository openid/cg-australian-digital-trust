## ADT CG Subgroups

The ADT CG will govern and oversee the activites of the subgroups. 

Subgroups will report back to the CG on activities, progress and broad socialisation/review of any work they undertake. 


## Subgroups
### Age Assurance

**Meets**: TBC.

**Slack**: https://oidf.slack.com/archives/C08HZ95GGKC

**Discussion**: 

- Explored whether there is sufficient immediate interest in the community to continue this group.
- Proposal to keep the age estimation Slack channel going and pause the sub group until such time as there are sufficient developments in the Australian market to warrant greater activity.

Members of this sub group will be able to access it and we are currently looking for the right location to put it. Given the considerable IP that went into it, the ask is that you do not share it outside this group without permission by the chairs.
ConnectID - supportive of participation. Working through details of document controls.

Presentation of Prior Art (TrustID) 


- Actions:

Let DP know if you would like access to the AusPayNet Trust Framework



### DADE AU 

**Meets**: Informally fortnightly

**Slack**: not required.

**Overview**: Will align with the global group

**Actions**:

**Discussion** 


### Other Items
- Organisation ID - John Phillips and Jo Spencer

Notes:
- UN/CEFACT Trade Facilitation and E-business
- Recommendation 49 conerns green washing in supply chains and has surfaced interest in a UN Transparency Protocol (in the sense of expected behaviours)and a digital identity anchor, which includes a source of authorty.
- The UNTP spec https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/about/
- The expectation is that other supply chains will commit to implementing UNTP through the Extensions Register.
- Call for participation is here https://uncefact.unece.org/display/uncefactpublic/UNCEFACT+Expert+Registration
- The primary purpose is to achieve regulatory compliance through provision of data. For example this will be a requirement of the digital product passport in the EU by 2030.
- It seems likley that over time, individual identity and officers of companies may be in scope, although in the first instance this is not the case.

- Innovation Days - question from MB about intention to host an Innovation Day
Notes:
- BC explained we are reconsidering the primary topic for the Innovation Day and suggested that this could be resilience and the role of identity in the face of that. We should wait until the Council of Financial Regulators has published some of its work in this area.
- DP suggested that DADE could be the topic of the Innovation Day.
