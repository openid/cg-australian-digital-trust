### Notes

### Minutes 

The meeting covered planning for upcoming events including a Christmas party and two industry showcases in November and December. The team discussed policy changes related to age verification for social media and reviewed progress on framework mapping exercises, with specific focus on Connect ID implementation and compliance status. The group also addressed ongoing documentation work, upcoming meetings, and various compliance matters while noting several team members' upcoming travel schedules.

- Bulding Agenda for ADT CG. To be finalised
- Suggested that we track of the Age Assurance "Ban"
