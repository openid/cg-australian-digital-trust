## Meeting Minutes

The meeting began with casual conversation about time zones and scheduling before transitioning to a discussion of the Productivity Commission report, where Olaf presented a draft submission focusing on competition, data privacy, and cross-border data flows. The team reviewed key themes from the report, including data minimization principles and consent-based sharing, while discussing challenges around the right to be forgotten and data sharing. The conversation ended with updates on upcoming events, including a roundtable discussion in Sydney and various identity and security conferences, along with plans for future Innovation Day activities.

**Productivity Commission Report Discussion**
The meeting began with Brad outlining the agenda, which included discussing the Productivity Commission report and other business matters. He reminded attendees about logistics such as signing participation agreements, using Slack, and updating the HackMD page with their names. Olaf then presented a draft submission for the Productivity Commission report, which he shared in Slack. He explained that the submission includes an introduction about the organization and highlights consensus positions from community groups, along with an attempt to articulate the productivity impact of each topic.

**Enhancing Competition and Data Privacy**
Olaf presented key themes from the Productivity Commission report, emphasizing the importance of enabling competition on service quality and price to deliver increased benefits for consumers and businesses. He highlighted the need for data minimization principles and consent-based sharing to address cybersecurity concerns and reduce consent fatigue. Olaf also discussed the challenges of cross-border data privacy, arguing that Australia's privacy regime should align with global standards like GDPR to facilitate cross-border data flows essential for the country's economy.

**Data Sharing and Privacy Challenges**
Olaf discussed the challenges of addressing data sharing and the "right to be forgotten" in their submission, expressing a need for additional support and input on these topics. Jo noted the importance of collaborating on sharing Australian information overseas and requested edit access to the document, which Olaf agreed to provide if needed. Both agreed to continue reviewing and refining the submission, with Olaf inviting further comments and input from others.

**Data Privacy and Provenance Discussion**
The group discussed the recommendation not to implement the right to be forgotten, acknowledging productivity benefits but emphasizing the importance of privacy and data minimization. They highlighted the need for clear guidance from regulators on appropriate data collection for KYC processes. Olaf presented his work on data provenance and role definitions, emphasizing the importance of accurate data for innovation and the need to clarify obligations to avoid duplicate efforts and externalized costs. The team agreed that their interim report was progressing well, with some areas still requiring elaboration, particularly around privacy aspects.

**Submission Deadline and Access Updates**
The team confirmed the submission deadline for Monday the 15th and agreed to proceed with the current submission direction, which received unanimous support from the group. Olaf granted access to those who requested it and asked Adam to use Google to help disambiguate email addresses. The conversation ended with Olaf needing to change locations, and the team agreed to reconvene shortly thereafter.

**Age Assurance Roundtable Planning Meeting**
The team discussed plans for an upcoming roundtable event on Thursday, May 18th in Sydney, hosted by Australia Payments Plus, featuring Tony Allen from the Age Assurance Technology Trial. The event will begin at 9:30 AM and include opening remarks from Tony followed by a Q&A session, with participants including ConnectID and other trial participants. Brad emphasized the importance of discussing both immediate concerns about age verification and future possibilities, referencing Victoria and David Birch's concept of protecting children in online spaces. Joe inquired about remote access options, which Brad will confirm later in the week, and mentioned a separate Melbourne event focused on insights and opportunities.


**Identity Events and Innovation Planning**
The group discussed upcoming events, including a roundtable with Tony in Melbourne on the 19th and various identity and security conferences across Australia and internationally. Brad mentioned plans for a broader Innovation Day event in November or early December, focusing on identity through the lifecycle. Dave reminded the group about an open OADIF poll for those interested in verifiable credential issuance. The team agreed to reconvene in Sydney next week for a meeting on the 18th, and Brad encouraged everyone to provide feedback on the Productivity Commission report.
