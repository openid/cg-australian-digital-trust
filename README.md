# Welcome to the Australian Digital Trust Community Group (CGADT) GitHub repo.

The Australian Digital Trust Community Group (ADT CG) fosters cooperation among professionals focused on digital identity and trust ecosystems in Australia.

Its purpose is to facilitate discussion on local initiatives, with the overarching objective of improving awareness and driving uptake of interoperable, standards-based digital trust services. 

To achieve its objective, the Community Group will convene stakeholders and provide networking opportunities amongst Australian industry participants with a focus on the following broad areas:
- Australian digital trust initiatives, use cases, and best practices (business).
- Australian standards usage (technical). 
- Data sharing use cases and standards (business and technical)
- Ecosystem-specific and economy-wide fraud requirements (business and technical).
- Increased adoption of digital trust services for everyone’s benefit.

Membership of the Community Group is open to all, inclusive of individuals from technology and service vendors, all industry sectors, representatives of consumer groups,  as well as federal and state governments. Community Group members are not required to join OIDF (although we recommend it). The only requirement is to sign a participation agreement - *see below*.
