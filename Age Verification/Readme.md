# Innovation Day: Age Verification Subgroup

## Outline 

The Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill 2024, passed late last year, has put the topic of age verification firmly in the spotlight. Building on the eSafety Commissioner’s Roadmap for Age Verification Online Safety Act, the new bill requires social media platforms to “take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under 16 years of age from having accounts”. 

Alongside this, in the last year we’ve also seen state-based legislation come into effect, requiring effective proof-of-age for online sales of some age restricted goods and services.

It’s a complex topic to navigate, with concerns covering implications for privacy as well as the practicality of implementing “reasonable steps”. Taking this sensitive topic head on, the Federal Government is undertaking an Age Assurance Technology Trial to “determine the effectiveness of available technologies”. But what does this mean for the broader community of service providers?

Through consideration of policy drivers, technology enablers and market need, attendees are invited to contribute to discussion designed to improve collective understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by age verification. Our panel of experts will cover relevant lessons from overseas and help surface the practical steps that we can take as professionals to ensure that age verification is a cornerstone of a trusted digital economy.
